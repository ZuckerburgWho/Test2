Richardo's Git cheat cheet:

cd ~/alldev/
git clone git@github.com:ZuckerburgWho/Test2.git
**make your changes to your files
**back to terminal
git add .
git commit -m "you can enter any message here in parentheses"
git push


now you have cloned a repository (you have a local copy of your REMOTE repository)
The remote repository is your online copy of your code
after cloning it and made your changes.. you save your changes and go back to terminal

in terminal, you typed git add .( the dot means "all" ... this flagged all the current files/changes to be committed... you can add specific files or add all of them. Adding all is the easiest)
you then typed git commit -m "xx" ---> this committed your local changes to your local repository (local files is a copy of your actual files, it is a summary of changes, not a full copy)
after updating your local repo, you pushed these changes to your remote repository (online repository)
